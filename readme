In the last crash everything get wiped out...
redoing from interrupt.
just going through net foundthis good article for virtual memory 
http://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Paging

date 1/10/11 --
redo all the interrupt task.Took help from the http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html and http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/idt.htm.
Nearly all the basic feature of interrupt are now done.Next time I will be doing PIT and keyboard isr. bye...

date 6/10/11
I competed the keyboard driver and pit today.
i just wrote the handler for both these and rest was already there.
right now I have written a common handler for isr and normal software interrupts, divide by zero, etc.
Next time I will do virtual memory implementation.

changing the code for virtual memory, trying to make changes as requirement.
In paging bit map is used to mark used and free frame. This is for current directory used, when this directory is replaced care must be taken to change these bits map. However these are only used by kerrnel to reallocate new frame and will have no as such effect but it may cause uneven usage of physical memory.
All directory structure should be page aligned.`
I am not using alloc or free frame in kernel directory as there is just 1 to 1 mapping in it, moreover there is no need to delete any frame in kernel. In later stage if there will be need of allocating or freeing I will write at that time.

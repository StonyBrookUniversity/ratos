RAP Register
The RAP (Register Address Pointer) register is used to
gain access to CSR and BCR registers on board the
PCnet-PCI II controller. The RAP contains the address
of a CSR or BCR.
As an example of RAP use, consider a read access to
CSR4. In order to access this register, it is necessary to
first load the value 0004h into the RAP by performing a
write access to the RAP offset of 12h (12h when WIO
mode has been selected, 14h when DWIO mode has
been selected). Then a second access is performed,
this time to the RDP offset of 10h (for either WIO or
DWIO mode). The RDP access is a read access, and
since RAP has just been loaded with the value of 0004h,
the RDP read will yield the contents of CSR4. A read of
the BDP at this time (offset of 16h when WIO mode has
